# TE-Project
Updated TE Project involving Baeolophus bicolor and Dryobates pubescens.



The preliminary steps includes renaming the fastq files for both species to have numbered names. The paired R1 and R2 files have the same beginning number; 1_R1, 1_R2, 2_R1, 2_R2 and so on.



Both the Baeolophus bicolor and Dryobates pubescens directories includes all tools used in order and what scripts were used.
